# ADR-001: Three-Track CSG Development Methodology for Production-Ready 3D Boolean Operations

## Status
**ACTIVE** - Implementation in progress

## Context

The current CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) implementation shows a 50% pass rate with specific failures in symmetric overlap scenarios (50%, 75% overlap cases). Volume validation tests reveal critical issues:

- **Symmetric Overlap Failures**: 50% overlap produces 133% error (1.166667 instead of 0.500000)
- **Volume Conservation Violations**: Results exceed mathematically possible bounds
- **Double-Counting**: BSP tree intersection algorithm includes boundary polygons from both directions
- **Performance**: Current <1ms performance meets targets but accuracy is insufficient

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive **Three-Track Development Methodology** to achieve production-ready 3D meshing algorithms and Boolean operations with professional-grade robustness.

### Track 1: Enhanced Test Coverage & Validation Framework

**Objective**: Expand validation to ≥80% pass rate with comprehensive analytical test cases

**Implementation**:
- Expand `cargo test --test csg_volume_validation -- --nocapture` with additional analytical test cases
- Implement closed-form mathematical solutions for sphere-cube, cylinder intersections
- Add systematic overlap percentage testing (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%) for all primitive pairs
- Create CSGAnalysisReport framework with statistical analysis and performance metrics
- Implement divergence theorem for robust volume calculations on input meshes

**Success Criteria**:
- Volume validation pass rate: ≥80% (up from current 50%)
- Volume conservation error: <1e-3 for overlapping operations, <1e-5 for non-overlapping
- Performance: <1ms standard operations (maintain current), <200ms complex cases
- Geometric accuracy: <5% error tolerance for analytical test cases

### Track 2: Root Cause Investigation & Diagnostic Enhancement

**Objective**: Systematic investigation of symmetric overlap failures with comprehensive diagnostic output

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced diagnostic output for symmetric overlap failures (`CSG_DEBUG_INTERSECTION=1`)
- Volume conservation tracking with Front=Outside/Back=Inside convention validation
- BSP tree classification debugging with parametric line-plane intersection formula validation
- Investigate double-counting elimination in intersection operations
- Document findings in ADRs following Cathedral Engineering principles

**Root Cause Identified**:
- **Primary Issue**: `collect_inside_polygons` function includes boundary polygons from both directions
- **Mathematical Error**: Intersection A ∩ B double-counts surfaces at overlap boundaries
- **BSP Tree Classification**: Boundary polygons incorrectly classified as "inside" from both trees

**Diagnostic Enhancements**:
- `collect_inside_polygons_with_diagnostics()`: Enhanced polygon classification logging
- `collect_boundary_intersection_polygons_enhanced()`: Boundary polygon processing analysis
- `remove_duplicate_polygons_enhanced_v2()`: Symmetric overlap deduplication tracking

### Track 3: Iterative TDD Algorithm Enhancement

**Objective**: Apply strict Red-Green-Refactor cycles for each algorithmic improvement

**Implementation**:
- **TDD RED**: Define exact requirements for symmetric overlap fix
- **TDD GREEN**: Implement corrected algorithm with enhanced deduplication
- **TDD REFACTOR**: Validate mathematical constraints and performance targets
- Safety protocol: immediate revert if any change causes test failures or performance degradation

**Algorithm Enhancements**:
1. **Enhanced Intersection Algorithm v14**: 
   - Strict inside polygon collection with boundary exclusion
   - Enhanced deduplication with 10x stricter epsilon for symmetric cases
   - Single boundary representation without double-counting
   
2. **Mathematical Constraints Enforcement**:
   - Volume conservation: result ≤ min(input_volumes)
   - Accuracy: <5% error tolerance for analytical test cases
   - Performance: maintain <1ms for standard operations

## Technical Requirements

### Exact Function Signatures (Backward Compatibility)
```rust
subtract(&[Triangle], &[Triangle]) -> Result<Vec<Triangle>, &'static str>
union(&[Triangle], &[Triangle]) -> Result<Vec<Triangle>, &'static str>
intersection(&[Triangle], &[Triangle]) -> Result<Vec<Triangle>, &'static str>
```

### CSG Operation Semantics
- `subtract(A, B)` means A - B (remove B's volume from A)
- Front=Outside and Back=Inside convention for BSP tree polygon classification
- EPSILON = 1e-5 for all floating-point comparisons

### Implementation Protocol
1. Run `cargo test --test csg_volume_validation -- --nocapture` after each change
2. Follow Cathedral Engineering with hierarchical module organization
3. Maintain all existing examples with backward compatibility
4. Complete production implementation with TDD methodology before removing @FALSEWORK annotations
5. Use #[allow(dead_code)] annotations to preserve test-covered code

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Quality Assurance**: TDD methodology with immediate revert safety protocol

### Negative

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Algorithm changes break existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Safety protocol with immediate revert on test failures
- **Risk**: Performance degradation during development
  - **Mitigation**: Continuous performance monitoring with <200ms thresholds
- **Risk**: Incomplete root cause analysis
